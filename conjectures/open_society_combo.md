# Open Society Combo Platform

## Problem
Online communities often fracture along ideological lines or suffer from echo chambers. Existing platforms either emphasise short-form posts, like Twitter, or long-form editing, like Wikipedia, with little cross-pollination. We conjecture that combining features could encourage more rigorous debate and collaborative improvement of ideas.

## Tentative Design
- **Wikipedia-style editing** so content can be continually refined.
- **Reddit-like discussions** attached to each article for open conversation and voting.
- **GitHub transparency** where all changes and issues are publicly logged.
- **Socratic questioning** prompts encourage participants to ask clarifying questions rather than attack.
- **Optional account-less participation** lets newcomers propose edits or comments without full registration, lowering the barrier to entry while still tracking contributions.

## Invitation for Criticism
This proposal aims to merge strengths of existing platforms to foster an open society approach. Feedback is welcome using our [critique template](../templates/critique_template.md) so we can refine or reject the idea based on reasoned criticism.
