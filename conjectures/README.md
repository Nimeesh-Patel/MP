# Conjectures

This folder collects feature or design ideas at their earliest stage.  Each file
should describe the **problem** being tackled, a tentative approach and any
initial reasoning.  Every proposal is considered a **conjecture** awaiting
criticism. When discussion leads to a deeper understanding, summarise the result
in [`../explanations.md`](../explanations.md).  If our overall outlook changes,
the main [`README.md`](../README.md) should be updated so everyone sees the
latest view first.
