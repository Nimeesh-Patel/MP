# Testing Guidelines

This document outlines the testing strategies for the Open Society Social Media project. Testing is a critical part of our conjecture and criticism process, ensuring that our code is robust and improvable.

## Backend Testing

### Framework
- Use `pytest` for unit and integration tests.

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
   ```
2. Create a `tests/` folder in the backend directory.

### Test Cases
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test individual functions (e.g., `hash_password`, `verify_password`).
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test API endpoints (e.g., `/register`, `/login`).

### Running Tests
Run all tests using:
```bash
pytest
```

## Frontend Testing

### Framework
- Use `Jest` and `React Testing Library` for unit and integration tests.

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react
   ```
2. Create a `tests/` folder in the `src/` directory.

### Test Cases
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test individual components (e.g., `Login`, `Signup`).
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test component interactions (e.g., form submission).

### Running Tests
Run all tests using:
```bash
npm test
```

## Philosophy Alignment

Testing aligns with our philosophy by:
- Treating tests as conjectures about expected behavior.
- Using test failures as criticism to improve the code.
- Documenting test results to build clear explanations.

Thank you for ensuring the quality of the Open Society Social Media project!
