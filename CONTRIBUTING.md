# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the Open Society Social Media project! We encourage contributions that align with our philosophy of conjecture, criticism, and explanation. Please follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions are constructive and transparent.

## Submitting Conjectures

1. **Create a Markdown File**:
   - Add your conjecture to the `conjectures/` folder.
   - Describe the problem, tentative approach, and initial reasoning.

2. **Use Clear Language**:
   - Write your conjecture in a way that is easy to understand.
   - Include examples or diagrams if necessary.

## Critiquing Conjectures

1. **Use the Critique Template**:
   - Follow the `templates/critique_template.md` for structured feedback.
   - Highlight flaws or propose alternatives constructively.

2. **Collaborate**:
   - Engage in discussions to refine the conjecture.
   - Be respectful and open to different perspectives.

## Submitting Code Changes

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Create a fork and clone it to your local machine.

2. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/add-login-validation`).

3. **Write Tests**:
   - Add unit or integration tests for your changes.
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Provide a clear description of your changes.
   - Reference related conjectures or critiques.

## Philosophy Alignment

Ensure your contributions align with the project's philosophy:
- Treat every implementation choice as a conjecture.
- Be open to criticism and collaboration.
- Strive for clear explanations and transparency.
