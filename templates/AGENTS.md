# Guidelines for Coding Agents

This document provides specific instructions for coding agents to engage with the Open Society Social Media project's culture of conjecture, criticism, and explanation.

## Understanding the Culture

1. **Conjecture**:
   - Treat every implementation choice as a hypothesis.
   - Propose solutions with clear reasoning and examples.

2. **Criticism**:
   - Analyze code for potential flaws or areas of improvement.
   - Provide structured feedback based on predefined metrics (e.g., performance, readability).

3. **Explanation**:
   - Document the reasoning behind each decision.
   - Use comments and markdown files to make explanations accessible.

## Engaging in Conjecture and Criticism

1. **Templates**:
   - Use the `conjectures/` folder to propose new ideas.
   - Follow the `templates/critique_template.md` for structured feedback.

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Run tests to validate conjectures.
   - Use test results as criticism to refine solutions.

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Interact with human contributors to refine explanations.
   - Be open to feedback and iterative improvement.

## Example Workflow

1. **Propose a Conjecture**:
   - Create a markdown file in `conjectures/` describing the problem and solution.

2. **Critique the Conjecture**:
   - Run tests and analyze code quality.
   - Document findings in `templates/critique_template.md`.

3. **Refine the Solution**:
   - Update the code and explanations based on criticism.

4. **Submit Changes**:
   - Follow the process outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Philosophy Alignment

Helpful: read `README.md`.

Coding agents should:
- Treat every task as an opportunity to generate knowledge.
- Use structured processes to engage in conjecture and criticism.
- Strive for clear explanations and transparency.
